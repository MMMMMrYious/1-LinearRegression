# LinearRegression
Linear regression in statistical learning in Python3(Hit the star if you think it is useful,Thx!)

1.1 SimpleLinearRegression 
    Well,in the simplest words, simple linear regression can draw a line Y = KX + B in the two-dimensional plane so that the points on the data set fall on this line as much  as possible. How should we solve the functional analytical formula of this line.

1.2 MutiLinearRegression  
  The method of establishing a simple regression model for each predictive variable alone is not completely satisfactory. When forming the estimation of regression coefficient, each regression equation ignores other variables. A better approach is to extend the simple linear regression model .so that it can directly include multiple predictors.
